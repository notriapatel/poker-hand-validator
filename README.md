# Poker Hands

In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards.


## Card and Hand Representations

In this exercise, cards are represented as two character strings: the first character representing the value of the card and the second representing the suite.

values: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0 (10), J (Jack), Q (Queen), K (King), A (Ace).
suites: H (Hearts), D (Diamonds), C (Clubs), S (Spades)

For example, '2H' is the two of hearts, '0D' is the 10 of diamonds, 'JC' is the Jack of Clubs.


## Hand Representations

In this exercise, hands are represented as a string of 5 two character card strings separated by spaces.
For example, '2H 2D 2C 2S JD' represents the hand four twos and the jack of diamonds.


## Hand Categories

These are all of the categories that poker hands can fall into, in order of lowest to highest scoring:

* High Card: Highest value card.
* One Pair: Two cards of the same value.
* Two Pairs: Two different pairs.
* Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same value.
* Straight: All cards are consecutive values.
* Flush: All cards of the same suit.
* Full House: Three of a kind and a pair.
* Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same value.
* Straight Flush: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.
* Royal Flush: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.

## A note about the Ace card

Ace can be high or low but not both.

Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5 is a straight.
10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace is a straight.
Queen, King, Ace, 2, 3 is NOT a straight.

## Poker Hand validation

Hands are invalid if any given hand or combination of given hands could not possibly arise from a standard 52 card deck. For example, if more than 4 aces appear across all hands.

A hand is also invalid if it does not contain exactly five cards.


## The Task

The task is to create a Poker Hand Evaluator that accepts a list of poker hands and categorises them into their best scoring category. An automated test suite has been provided that will check the category for a number of possible poker hands.

The task is split into multiple parts. **Please complete PART 1 of the task on your own.** (For extra credit, if you are feeling adventurous, you're welcome to also complete PART 1b).


### Tests

Test suites have been provided. You may add your own additional tests if you wish, but your code will be assessed against a pristine version of the test suite, so you should **not** change the existing test suite expectations (unless you spot an error in the tests, in which case let us know).

For setup and details of how to run the test suite please see the language specific README.

### Organisation of the code

You may organise your code however you see fit, providing the test suite still runs as is.

### Assessment

Your solution will be scored according to whether or not your code works (i.e. passes all tests). If your code passes all tests, general code quality will also be assessed.
